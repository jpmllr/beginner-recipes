		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Before modern civilization, our ancestors used to boil water in a pot, throw stuff into a pot, and cooked it until it tasted good.  Things have became complicated these days, now that people often think about measurements and other technical terms.  Cooking is best done when you are guided by your intuition and senses.</p>

		<p>This is a classic vegetable soup recipe that is easy for anyone to make.  With simple ingredients, technique, and basic intuition, there is no way to fail making this classic.  Even though  I downplayed measurements, I'll still include them here.  You don't even need to have any vegetable or chicken stock.</p>
