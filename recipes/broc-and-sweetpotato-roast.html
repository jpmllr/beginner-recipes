		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Before modern civilization, our ancestors used to boil water in a pot, throw stuff into a pot, and cooked it until it tasted good.  Things have became complicated these days, now that people often think about measurements and other technical terms.  Cooking is best done when you are guided by your intuition and senses.</p>

		<p>This is a classic vegetable soup recipe that is easy for anyone to make.  With simple ingredients, technique, and basic intuition, there is no way to fail making this classic.  Even though  I downplayed measurements, I'll still include them here.  You don't even need to have any vegetable or chicken stock.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 Medium Onion</li>
			<li>3 Carrots</li>
			<li>2 Celery Stalks</li>
			<li>6 Roma Tomatoes (or equivalent)</li>
			<li>1/2 stick Butter</li>
			<li>1 Lemon</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp Cayenne</li>
			<li>1 tsp Thyme</li>
			<li>2 Bayleaves</li>
			<li>1 tsp Oregano</li>
			<li>1 tsp Rosemary</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
			<li>Salt and Pepper</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Fill large pot halfway with water, set on stove over high heat, bring to a boil</li>
			<li>While you are waiting for your water to boil, dice onions, chop carrots into coins and celery into pieces.</li>
			<li>When water reaches to a boil, add onions, carrots and celery into the pot.  Let cook for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>While waiting, cut tomatoes into bite sized chunks, then throw into the pot once those 10 minutes are up.  Bring down to a simmer and add butter.  Stir and wait for 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>After those 20 minutes are up, add in the spices, lemon juice, salt and pepepr, stir, adjust spices to taste.  If your soup is too thick, you can add about a cup or two of water, but remember, you'll have adjust your spices accordingly.  <strong>You can only add, never subract</strong></li>
			<li>Mince garlic, add to pot and then turn off heat.</li>
		</ol>
